# farcaster_sdk

[](farcaster_sdk)[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/farcaster_sdk.svg?label=dev&include_prereleases)](https://pub.dev/packages/farcaster_sdk)

This is the unofficial Flutter SDK for the Farcaster protocol. It contains two useful API clients (one for Farcaster Hubs using `Hubble` and one for `Warpcast`) to be used in your Flutter app.

## üìö Getting started

### Available platforms

This library is available for both `Flutter` and `Dart` projects. These are the platforms where you can use this sdk:
- [x] Android
- [x] iOS
- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux
- [x] MacOS

This package **does not work** on the web.

### Add dependency

You can use this command to add `farcaster_sdk` to your Flutter app:

```bash
flutter pub add farcaster_sdk
```

It can also be used in `dart` projects by running a similar command:

```bash
dart pub add farcaster_sdk
```

Or you can manually add `farcaster_sdk` into the dependencies section in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
    farcaster_sdk: ^REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_VERSION
```

The current latest version is `0.0.4`.

## ‚ùì Usage

The goal of this library is to be really simple to use in your Flutter apps. 

Depending on which API client you want to use, you just need to initialize it. Both clients are `singletons` by design to be able to be reused inside your app.

### Hubble (Farcaster Hubs)

```dart
import 'package:farcaster_sdk/farcaster_sdk.dart';

final farcasterHubbleClient = FarcasterHubbleClient();

void main() async {
    await farcasterHubbleClient.init(
        "HUB_HOST",
        HUB_PORT,
        // optional credentials (insecure by default)
    );
}
```

### Warpcast

```dart
import 'package:farcaster_sdk/farcaster_sdk.dart';

final farcasterWarpcastClient = FarcasterWarpcastClient();

void main() async {
    await farcasterWarpcastClient.init(
        // Your API url, default is "https://api.warpcast.com", you can leave this blank.
    );
}
```

## üßæ TODOs

- [x] Check authentication for Warpcast client
- [x] Stable version for Warpcast client
- [] Add documentation for Warpcast client
- [] Stable version for Hubble client
- [] Add documentation for Hubble client
- [] Create unified models for both Hubble and Warpcast client to have consistency in the results
